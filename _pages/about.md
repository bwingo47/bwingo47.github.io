Welcome! I am a Robotics Ph.D. Candidate, supervised by [Dr. Seth Hutchinson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/) at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/).

I am currently a Visiting Ph.D. researcher at [INRIA Paris](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris) in the [WILLOW team](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/), where I am supervised by Dr. [Justin Carpentier](https://jcarpent.github.io/). My primary focus is on developing fast and efficient motion planning and control algorithms for complex, high-degree-of-freedom robots. During my time at INRIA, I developed a novel differential inverse kinematics solver that outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by leveraging the [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) library. We have released [LoIK](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/LoIK), a high-performance, open-source differential inverse kinematics solver for robotic systems with complex constraints.

My broader research interest lies in bridging numerical optimization techniques with rigid-body-dynamics algorithms to solve complex robotic motion planning and control problems. My experience spans a wide range of applications: I have created a full-stack trajectory optimization and model predictive control pipeline for agile legged locomotion; designed robust adaptive controllers for manipulator arms to handle dynamic uncertainties; developed hierarchical control policies for wheeled-inverted-pendulum humanoids; and, in my industry work at [Georgia Pacific](https://www.gppackaging.com/innovation/), deployed perception and motion planning algorithms for autonomous warehouse navigation and robotic packaging. Across these diverse platforms, my goal is to develop computationally efficient and mathematically rigorous algorithms that enable robots to interact intelligently and safely with the real world.

<!-- Welcome! I am a Robotics Ph.D. student in the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) and [George Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Seth Hutchinson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/). Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/). 

My research is built on optimization and control theories. My current focus concerns the efficiency and robustness of trajectory generation and control for legged systems to achieve agile and dynamic motion. Common topics deployed in my research include: direct collocation, differential dynamic programming (DDP), distributed optimization (ADMM), model predictive control (MPC), hierarchical whole-body control, control-Lyapunov functions, and operational space control. I hope to apply my proficiency in optimization, dynamics and control to enable robotics systems to maneuver in the real world. -->
