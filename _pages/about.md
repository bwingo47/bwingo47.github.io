Welcome! I am a Robotics Ph.D. student in the [Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics) and [George Woodruff School of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am working under the suppervision of [Dr. Seth Hutchinson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/). Before joining Georgia Tech, I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/). 

My research is built on optimization and control theories. My current focus concerns the efficiency and robustness of trajectory generation and control for legged systems to achieve agile and dynamic motion. Common topics deployed in my research include: direct collocation, differential dynamic programming (DDP), distrbuted optimization (ADMM), model predictive control (MPC), hierarchical whole-body control, control-Lyapunov functions, and operational space control. I hope to apply my proficiency in optimization, dynamics and control to enable robotics systems to maneuver in the real world.

<!-- Getting started
======
* Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
* Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
* Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
* Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
* Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
* Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->
