<h2>
    Low-Complexity Constraint Differential Inverse Kinematics
</h2>
<p>
		I introduced a novel constrained differential inverse kinematics solver that reframes 
		the problem from an Augmented Lagrangian perspective. The resulting solver, <strong>LoIK</strong>, 
		achieves linear-time complexity in both the total degrees-of-freedom of the robot, and the number of 
		constraints in the problem. The low time-complexity makes it suitable for real-time control and planning of 
		complex systems like humanoid robots with multiple equality/inequality constraints.
		As shown in the benchmarks, <strong>LoIK</strong> consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, 
		general-purpose quadratic programming solvers. This work was published in 
		Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024. Pre-print available <a href="https://hal.science/hal-04607809">here</a>.  
		The open-source solver is available on <a href="https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/LoIK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

<h2>
    Agile Quadruped Jumping Through Full-Centroidal-Momentum Model Predictive Control
</h2>
<p>
    I designed a real-time convex model predictive controller (MPC) for dynamic quadruped jumping,
		utilizing the full-centroidal-dynamics model, via the centroidal-momentum matrix.
    The designed controller is capable of correcting reference
    trajectory in real time, and is robust enough to be directly deployed on hardware without any additional
    low-level whole-body controllers. Hardware experiments for continuous 90-degree jump-turns 
		are conducted on the MIT mini-cheetah platform. This work is published at the
		IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). Pre-print
    available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01548">here</a>.

<h2>
    Momentum-Aware Planning Synthesis for Dynamic Legged Locomotion
</h2>
<p>
    I developed a bi-level trajectory optimization framework
    for generating dynamic and agile motion for quadruped robots. The proposed framework 
    consists of two optimization components: a centroidal optimization using 
    reduced order centroidal dynamics with linear and angular momentum as decision variables; and 
    a whole-body-dynamics-based differential-dynamic-programming optimization. Consensus constraints are 
    enforced to drive convergence between the two components. Below are sample trajectories generated using 
		the proposed framework for the quadruped A1, to perform high-speed trotting, zero-gravity body re-orientation, and jump-turns.

<h2>
    Extending Riemannian Motion Policies to Underactuated Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum Robots 
</h2>
<p>
    For this project, I developed a reactive policy motion planning pipeline for wheeled-inverted-pendulum
    based humanoids. A dynamics decomposition technique is proposed to split the full dynamics
    of the robot into fully actuated and underactuated subsystems. Leveraging Riemannian
    motion policies and differential-dynamic-programming, one can
    independently plan trajectories for fully actuated and underactuated dynamics, which are then 
    combined into a single motion plan through null-space projection. This work is published at
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196866">ICRA 2020</a>

<h2>
    Adaptively Robust Control Policy Synthesis Through Riemannian Motion Policies 
</h2>
<p>
    In this project, I proposed a robust control-Lyapunov-function (CLF)-based tracking 
    controller, capable of handling large magnitudes of dynamic uncertainty 
    and external disturbances. Additionally, I devised an automatic robust gain 
    scheduling procedure that guarantees the stability and boundedness of the 
    proposed controller. Experimental result on the KUKA iiwa manipulator platform is demonstrated below, 
    for object tracking and obstacle avoidance tasks. This work is published at 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308931">Control Systems Letters 2021</a>

<h2>
    Distributed Optimal Control Framework based on Coordinate Descent Optimization for Multi-Agent Robots 
</h2>
<p>
    In this paper, I helped develop a distributed optimal
    control framework for a multi-agent robotics system based
    on coordinate-descent optimization. The proposed framework exploits
    the underlying graph topology to compute the optimal control
    trajectory in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm is then tested 
		on a problem where a team of robots is tasked with establishing a communication link
    between source and destination while minimizing the overall
    system mobility and communication energy cost. Here is a sample
    of our algorithm running on the Gatech Robotarium platform using 
    a cluster of 8 mobile robots. This work is published at 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551489">CASE 2021</a>
