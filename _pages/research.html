Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you

the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. 
You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public

    Momentum-Aware Planning Synthesis for Dynamic Legged Locomotion
</h1>
<p>
    In this project, we developed a bi-level trajectory optimization framework
    for generating dynamic and agile motion for quadruped robots. Our framework 
    consists of two optimization components: a centroidal optimization using 
    reduced order centroidal dynamics with momentum as decision variables; and 
    a DDP-based full dynamics optimization. Additional consensus constraints are 
    enfoced to bridge the two components. Here are sample trajectories, for 
    quadruped A1, generated using developed framework. A journal extension of this 
    project is currently work in progress.
