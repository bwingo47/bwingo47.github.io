<h2>
    Agile Quadruped Jumping Through Full Centroidal Momentum Model Predictive Control
</h2>
<p>
    Current progress on controlling quadruped robots through dynamic jumping and running 
    motions. I designed a convex MPC controller utilizing full centroidal dynamics and 
    centroidal momentum matrix. The designed controller is able to regenerate reference
    trajectory in real time, and robust enough to be directly deployed on hardware without 
    low-level whole-body controller. Preliminary result for continuous 90 degrees jump 
    turn is shown here on the MIT mini-cheetah platform. This work is accepted to appear 
    in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) later this year. Pre-print
    can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01548">here</a>.

<h2>
    Momentum-Aware Planning Synthesis for Dynamic Legged Locomotion
</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we developed a bi-level trajectory optimization framework
    for generating dynamic and agile motion for quadruped robots. Our framework 
    consists of two optimization components: a centroidal optimization using 
    reduced order centroidal dynamics with momentum as decision variables; and 
    a DDP-based full dynamics optimization. Additional consensus constraints are 
    enforced to bridge the two components. Here are sample trajectories, for 
    quadruped A1, generated using developed framework. A journal extension of this 
    project is currently in progress.

<h2>
    Extending Riemmanian Motion Policies to Underactuated Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum Robots 
</h2>
<p>
    For this project, we developed a reactive motion planning pipeline for wheeled-inverted-pendulum
    based humanoids. We proposed a dynamics decomposition technique that splits the full dynamics
    of the robot into fully actuated and underactuated subsystems. Leveraging Riemannian
    motion policies, differential dynamic programming, we were able to 
    independently plan trajectories for fully actuated and underactuated dynamics, which are then 
    combined into a single motion plan through null-space projection. This work is published at 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196866">ICRA 2020</a>

<h2>
    Adaptively Robust Control Policy Synthesis Through Riemannian Motion Policies 
</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we proposed a robust control Lyapunov function based tracking 
    controller, capable of handling large magnitude of dynamics uncertainties 
    and external disturbances. Additionally, we devised an automatic robust gain 
    adaptation procedure that guarantees the stability and boundedness of the 
    proposed controller. Experimental result on KUKA iiwa platform is shown here, 
    for object tracking and obstacle avoidance. This work is published at 
    the May issue of 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9308931">Control Systems Letters 2021</a>

<h2>
    Distributed Optimal Control Framework based on Coordinate Descent Optimization for Multi-Agent Robots 
</h2>
<p>
    In this paper, we present a distributed optimal
    control framework for a multi-agent robotics system based
    on coordinate descent optimization. Our framework exploits
    the underlying graph topology to compute the optimal control
    trajectory in a distributed manner. To show the efficacy
    of the framework, we apply it to a problem where a team
    of robots is tasked with establishing a communication link
    between source and destination while minimizing the overall
    system mobility and communication energy cost. Here is a sample
    of our algorithm running on the Gatech Robotarium platform using 
    a cluster of 8 mobile robots. This work is published at 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9551489">CASE 2021</a>
