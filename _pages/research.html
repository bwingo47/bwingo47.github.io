<h1>
    Agile Quadruped Jumping Through Full Centroidal Momentum Model Predictive Control
</h1>
<p>
    Current progress on controlling quadruped robots through dynamic jumping and running 
    motions. I designed a convex MPC controller utilizing full centroidal dynamics and 
    centroidal momentum matrix. The designed controller is able to regenerate reference
    trajectory in real time, and robust enough to be directly deployed on hardware without 
    low-level whole-body controller. Preliminary result for continous 90 degrees jump 
    turn is shown here on the MIT mini-cheetah platform. Journal submission of this work
    is currently in progress.

<h1>
    Momentum-Aware Planning Synthesis for Dynamic Legged Locomotion
</h1>
<p>
    In this project, we developed a bi-level trajectory optimization framework
    for generating dynamic and agile motion for quadruped robots. Our framework 
    consists of two optimization components: a centroidal optimization using 
    reduced order centroidal dynamics with momentum as decision variables; and 
    a DDP-based full dynamics optimization. Additional consensus constraints are 
    enfoced to bridge the two components. Here are sample trajectories, for 
    quadruped A1, generated using developed framework. A journal extension of this 
    project is currently in progress.

<h1>
    Extending Riemmanian Motion Policies to Underactuated Wheeled-Inverted-Pendulum Robots 
</h1>
<p>
    For this project, we developed a reactive motion planning pipeline for wheeled-inverted-pendulum
    based humanoids. We proposed a dynamics decomposition technique that splits the full dynamics
    of the robot into fully actuated and underactuated subsystems. Leveraging Riemannian
    motion policies, differential dynamic programming, we were able to 
    independently plan trajectories for fully actuated and underactuated dynamics, which are then 
    combined into a single motion plan through null-space projection. This work is published in 
    <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9196866">ICRA 2020</a>
