Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you 
separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your 
website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute 
the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. 
You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public
 GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, 
 the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages 
 based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
